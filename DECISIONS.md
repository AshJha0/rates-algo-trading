# Decision records

Each record states the context at the time, the decision, and the consequences we accept. Records are never edited after the fact; a later record supersedes an earlier one and says so.

## DR-001: Repository name and licence

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The project needs a name that says what it is and a licence that lets anyone read, run and reuse it from the first commit, including people assessing the work.

Decision. The repository is `AshJha0/rates-algo-trading`, licensed under Apache License 2.0 with copyright 2026 Ashish Jha.

Amended 2026-10-31 (owner). The repository was created public and switched to private the same day; it stays private until the owner is satisfied with the finished work, then becomes public. Everything is still written as if public: no raw downloaded data, credentials or third-party licensed content is committed (see DR-006), and the word policy (DR-007) applies throughout.

Consequences. GitHub Pages does not publish from a private repository on a free plan, so the Docs workflow builds the site with `--strict` on every push but the deploy step stays skipped until the repository is public and the Pages source is set to GitHub Actions. Apache 2.0's patent grant and notice requirements apply to contributors.

## DR-002: Java for the hot path and venue layer, Python for research

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The platform needs a low-latency event core and venue gateways, and a separate research workflow for calibration and analysis. Choices for the core were Java, C++ and Rust.

Decision. Java (JDK 25 LTS, DR-003) for the event core, analytics used on the hot path, venue gateways and simulators. Python 3.12 for research, calibration and analysis. No C++ or Rust unless a measured latency gap on the pinned benchmark host (DR-005) demands it, in which case a decision record states the gap and the component.

Consequences. The Java hot path must be allocation-free and single-writer to meet latency goals without native code; this is checked by tests, not assumed. Research code is not on the latency path and may use pandas freely. The Python and Java sides share pinned contracts (API_SPEC.md) rather than code.

## DR-003: JDK 25 LTS toolchain with a JDK 27 forward-compatibility leg

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The project should build on a long-term-support JDK and learn early about breakage on the next release.

Decision. The gating toolchain is JDK 25 LTS, on Linux and Windows. CI also runs an informational leg on JDK 27 (not gating). The gating toolchain moves to JDK 29 LTS when it ships and the dependencies support it.

Consequences. Language features up to Java 25 may be used. A JDK 27 failure is a tracked issue, not a blocked merge. The move to 29 will need a decision record naming the date and the dependency versions.

## DR-004: USD SOFR swaps and US Treasuries first; EUR and GBP follow with a stated assumption

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. Free transaction-level data exists for USD rates (DTCC SDR public dissemination, FINRA TRACE Treasury aggregates) but there is no comparable free tape for EUR or GBP swaps or government bonds.

Decision. P1 analytics implement USD SOFR swaps and US Treasuries first, with EUR and GBP calendars, day counts and schedule conventions in the same phase. EUR and GBP quoting arrive in P3. Venue-simulator calibration for EUR and GBP reuses the USD-fitted distribution shapes (arrival rates, size distributions, response times) with a scaling assumption stated in `data/presets.yaml`, because no free EUR or GBP transaction tape exists to fit them.

Consequences. Any EUR or GBP result carries a note that the venue parameters are scaled from USD fits. If a free EUR or GBP tape becomes available, a decision record replaces the scaling with a fit.

## DR-005: Where latency is measured

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. Hosted CI runners share hardware with unknown neighbours, so their timings are not comparable run to run.

Decision. For CI, latency jobs run on the development machine (recorded by model, CPU, kernel or OS build, and JVM flags in every report) and are informational. Gating thresholds apply only on a pinned Linux host when one is available. Every report records the machine it ran on.

Consequences. `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` carries no numbers until a report exists, and every number it later carries names its machine and date. A regression seen only on a hosted runner is investigated, not acted on.

## DR-006: Public data licensing

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The project uses public data from government and market sources, each with its own terms. Redistribution of raw downloads may be prohibited or require attribution.

Decision. The repository commits fitted parameters (`data/presets.yaml`) and small fixtures needed by tests, never raw downloads. For each source, `data/SOURCES.md` records the licence or terms to verify, and the research package records a SHA-256 and a manifest for each file used (`ratesresearch.provenance`). Fixtures are small enough to be clearly derived works and name their source.

Consequences. Reproducing a fit requires re-downloading the source; the manifest lets a reader confirm they have the same bytes. A source whose terms turn out to forbid even derived parameters is removed and the record says so.

## DR-007: Naming of role-preparation material

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The learning text includes question-and-answer material useful for preparing for technical discussions. The owner's standing instruction is that public repositories do not use a particular word for such material.

Decision. All such material is titled as learning material or as a knowledge check (LEARN.md Section 15). The repository does not use the word that names a hiring conversation, and the pull request template includes a check for it.

Consequences. Contributors run a grep before pushing. The content is unchanged; only the framing is.

## DR-008: Competition model for RFQ win probability

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. A dealer quoting into a multi-dealer RFQ needs a model of the probability of winning as a function of distance from mid. Fitting that model requires seeing the quotes of competing dealers. Public data (DTCC SDR) shows executed trades only, never the quotes that lost.

Decision. Win probability is a declared assumption band, not a fitted quantity. The quoting engine (P3) takes a parametrised curve (for example logistic in price distance with a stated slope and midpoint) and the back-tester (P5) reports results across the declared band, not at a point. The band and its rationale are written in `data/presets.yaml` and in LEARN.md Section 7.

Consequences. No result from this project can claim a fitted hit rate. Sensitivity to the band is reported with every quoting result. If a data source with quote-level RFQ data becomes available under acceptable terms, a decision record replaces the assumption with a fit.

## DR-P4-01: Router messages as fixed-length header and rows, template ids 80 to 82, schema version unchanged

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. Every routing decision must be reconstructible from the journal, so the per-venue cost inputs and the split must be journaled. A decision has a variable number of venues. SBE supports repeating groups, but schema v1 is all fixed-length messages (API_SPEC.md Section 2) and the brief reserves template ids 80 to 89 for the router.

Decision. A decision is one RouteDecision (80) followed by one RouteDecisionVenue (81) per venue, linked by `decisionId` and a row index; child order audit records are ChildOrderTransition (82). Five enums are appended to the types. The schema version stays 0: the change only adds types and messages with new ids, no existing field moves, and no journal written with v1 exists in a release.

Consequences. Readers of a decision must collect rows; `DecisionCodec` does so and rejects rows out of sequence. If another phase adds messages in the same round, the coordinator merges the XML; if the coordinator prefers to bump the schema version for the combined additions, these messages move with it unchanged.

## DR-P4-02: Re-route only quantity the venue has confirmed cancelled

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. A child cancelled for escalation or a book move may have fills in flight. Re-routing its whole remainder at once can make the children exceed the parent when those fills arrive.

Decision. The router re-routes only quantity a Cancelled report (or reconciliation) confirms will not fill: ordered minus the larger of our cumulative and the venue's reported cumulative. The state machine keeps the invariant cum + leaves + cancelled = ordered, with late fills reducing leaves.

Consequences. Escalation waits one venue round trip. The parent can never be overfilled by the router (`RouterChaosPropertiesTest`). A venue that reported a cancel with a cumulative below what it had filled would break the guarantee; the book counts that as an anomaly.

## DR-P4-03: Declared cost-model defaults; refit deferred

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The brief asks for square-root impact parameters refitted from simulator data. The P2 venue simulators are not available to this phase.

Decision. Ship a declared preset (config version 1) in `data/presets.yaml` under `router`, mirrored in `RouterPresets` and checked by `RouterPresetsTest`. The queue model and the passive-or-aggressive comparison reuse the maths of the owner's earlier execution library (AshJha0/electronic-trading 2.0.0, API_SPEC.md Sections 8.3, 13.1 and 13.2), adapted to this project's units and rewritten to be allocation-free.

Consequences. Costs are model estimates under stated assumptions. A refit from P2 simulator output, with a manifest, replaces the preset under a new config version.

## DR-P4-04: Greedy marginal allocation

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The allocation is a small integer program over a handful of venues with minimum sizes, lots and caps, solved on the hot path.

Decision. Greedy by marginal cost per unit in blocks of a common increment, at most `maxSteps` steps, ties to the lower row.

Consequences. Optimal on the increment lattice for convex per-venue costs without minimum sizes (checked against enumeration); a heuristic otherwise. Bounded, deterministic and allocation-free.

## DR-P4-05: Cookbook recipe numbered 17

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. The brief names the router recipe 16; COOKBOOK.md's planned list gives 16 to the P3 kill-switch recipe and 17 to "route a hedge order and read the markout report (P4)".

Decision. The repository wins: the router recipe is 17, and it prints a markout line as the planned title says.

Consequences. No collision with the P3 recipe.

## DR-P4-06: The router routes one instrument across venues; the hedger chooses the instrument

Date: 2026-10-31

Context. A rates hedge can be done in cash bonds or futures; a futures contract and a cash bond are different instruments with basis risk between them.

Decision. A parent names one instrument; the router splits it across the venues that list it. Venue kind (CLOB or futures) selects default parameters only. Choosing between cash and futures, and the hedge ratio, belongs to the P3 hedger.

Consequences. The router does not net or convert between instruments. A cross-instrument router would be a later change with its own decision record.
