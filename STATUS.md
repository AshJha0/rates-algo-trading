# Status

Updated 2026-10-31.

## Phase table

Plan-days are the unit the plan was written in. Wall-clock days are calendar days with two to three working sessions per day. Gate status is one of: not started, in progress, gate open (work done, acceptance pending), closed.

| Phase | Scope | Planned plan-days | Planned wall-clock days | Actual wall-clock days | Started | Gate status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Foundations: clock and timers, SBE schema v1, journal and replayer, Python package, docs, CI | 10 | 1 | in progress | 2026-10-31 | in progress |
| P1 | Analytics: conventions, curves, swaps, bonds, futures, QuantLib goldens | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P2 | Venues: FIX 4.4, SBE book feed, D2C RFQ, D2D CLOB with workup, SEF rules, event loop | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P2 (W3 venues) | Venue half: FIX 4.4 codec and session, three venue simulators, SBE book feed, reference data, market data quality, conformance suites | 9 | 0.75 | 0.3 | 2026-10-31 | gate open |
| P3 | Quoting engine, risk engine, hedger | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P4 | Smart order router | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P5 | Back-tester with pre-registration, latency jobs | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P6 | Documentation, regulation mapping, knowledge check, release | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |

## Estimate versus actual

Filled at each gate. Each entry records the planned and actual figures, the reviewer and CI time separately from working time, and what the difference is attributed to.

### P0 gate

Not yet reached. Planned: 10 plan-days, 1 wall-clock day, started 2026-10-31.

### P2 venue half (W3)

Planned: 9 plan-days, 0.75 wall-clock days. Actual: work ran from about 00:55 to 08:30 UTC on 2026-10-31 (first and last commits on the branch `claude/p2-venues-3d7318`), of which about five hours were a pause requested by the owner, so about 2.5 hours of working time, or 0.3 wall-clock days on this table's definition. The difference is attributed to building against fixed contracts (SBE schema, journal, clock) and to the conformance runner, which found the two interoperability faults early (QuoteCancelType 5 is not FIX 4.4; cancel acks must alias the original ClOrdID). Reviewer and CI time are not included and have not happened yet.

Evidence for the venue part of the P2 gate, from `mvn -B -ntp verify` on JDK 25.0.5, Windows 11, 2026-10-31: `CertSuiteTest` 16 scripts green across the three venues and every flow; `SyntheticDayTest` 568 RFQs with zero sequence errors; cancel-on-disconnect in `d2c-cancel-on-disconnect`, `clob-cancel-on-disconnect` and `ChaosTest`; gap recovery in `ChaosTest` (session resend and feed snapshot); `MarketDataQualityTest` property test; `AllocationTest` zero bytes over one million messages; JaCoCo line floor 0.85 met per module; SpotBugs clean. The gate closes when the same jobs pass in GitHub Actions on Linux and Windows.

## Open items

- P0: local verification done on 2026-10-31 (mvn verify on JDK 25.0.5 and JDK 27: 50 Java tests, coverage floor met, SpotBugs clean; ruff, mypy, pytest 16 passed; mkdocs build --strict clean; cookbook recipes recorded and checked by tools/check_cookbook.py). The gate closes when the same jobs are green in GitHub Actions on Linux and Windows.
- P0: the repository is private until the owner is satisfied (DR-001 amendment); the site deploys once it is public and the Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" (docs/GITHUB_PAGES.md).
