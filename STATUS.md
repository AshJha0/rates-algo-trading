# Status

Updated 2026-10-31.

## Phase table

Plan-days are the unit the plan was written in. Wall-clock days are calendar days with two to three working sessions per day. Gate status is one of: not started, in progress, gate open (work done, acceptance pending), closed.

| Phase | Scope | Planned plan-days | Planned wall-clock days | Actual wall-clock days | Started | Gate status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Foundations: clock and timers, SBE schema v1, journal and replayer, Python package, docs, CI | 10 | 1 | in progress | 2026-10-31 | in progress |
| P1 | Analytics: conventions, curves, swaps, bonds, futures, QuantLib goldens | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P2 | Venues: FIX 4.4, SBE book feed, D2C RFQ, D2D CLOB with workup, SEF rules, event loop | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P3 | Quoting engine, risk engine, hedger | 18 | 1.5 | 0.3 | 2026-10-31 | gate open: all P3 gates pass locally on the branch; CI and merge pending |
| P4 | Smart order router | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P5 | Back-tester with pre-registration, latency jobs | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P6 | Documentation, regulation mapping, knowledge check, release | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |

## Estimate versus actual

Filled at each gate. Each entry records the planned and actual figures, the reviewer and CI time separately from working time, and what the difference is attributed to.

### P0 gate

Not yet reached. Planned: 10 plan-days, 1 wall-clock day, started 2026-10-31.

## Open items

- P0: local verification done on 2026-10-31 (mvn verify on JDK 25.0.5 and JDK 27: 50 Java tests, coverage floor met, SpotBugs clean; ruff, mypy, pytest 16 passed; mkdocs build --strict clean; cookbook recipes recorded and checked by tools/check_cookbook.py). The gate closes when the same jobs are green in GitHub Actions on Linux and Windows.
- P0: the repository is private until the owner is satisfied (DR-001 amendment); the site deploys once it is public and the Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" (docs/GITHUB_PAGES.md).

### P3 gate

Planned: 18 plan-days, 1.5 wall-clock days. Actual: 0.3 wall-clock days, about 7 hours on 2026-10-31 from about 01:00 to 08:00 UTC in one working session, including one pause while the session's model was switched. The work ran in parallel with P1, P2, P4, P5 and P6 in separate sessions, against stubs of their interfaces, so binding to the real implementations (coordinator) is not included in the actual. The difference is attributed to the stubs: no time was spent on integration, data or calibration, which the plan-days include.

Gate results, from `mvn -B -ntp verify` on JDK 25.0.5, Windows 11, 2026-10-31, branch `claude/p3-quoting-risk-hedge-70e454`:

| Gate | Result | Source |
|---|---|---|
| One million simulated RFQs, zero limit violations at the sink | 1,000,000 RFQs, 476,215 quotes, 30,933 fills, 4,446 hedge parents, 0 violations | `MillionRfqTest` |
| DV01 ladder equals full revaluation to 1e-6 of notional | 300 random sequences, every pillar within tolerance | `RiskEngineTest.incrementalLadderEqualsFullRevaluation`, also `ChaosTest`, `MillionRfqTest` |
| Chaos test clean | 10,000 scenarios, 9,272 kills and 646 resets exercised, 0 invariant failures | `ChaosTest` |
| Kill switch exercised | state machine, listeners, four-eyes reset, kill during reset | `KillSwitchControllerTest`, `ChaosTest`, `QuotingEngineTest`, recipe 16 |
| Hedger beats immediate full hedging on variance and modelled cost | residual sd 10,352 at cost 62,418 against 647,435 at 111,862 | `HedgePlannerTest.costAwarePlanBeatsImmediateFullHedgeOnVarianceAndCost` |
| Allocation-free per-RFQ path after warm-up | five windows of 20,000 RFQs: 280, 0, 0, 0, 0 bytes (DR-P3-08) | `QuotingAllocationTest` |
