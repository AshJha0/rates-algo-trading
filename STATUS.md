# Status

Updated 2026-10-31.

## Phase table

Plan-days are the unit the plan was written in. Wall-clock days are calendar days with two to three working sessions per day. Gate status is one of: not started, in progress, gate open (work done, acceptance pending), closed.

| Phase | Scope | Planned plan-days | Planned wall-clock days | Actual wall-clock days | Started | Gate status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Foundations: clock and timers, SBE schema v1, journal and replayer, Python package, docs, CI | 10 | 1 | in progress | 2026-10-31 | in progress |
| P1 | Analytics: conventions, curves, swaps, bonds, futures, QuantLib goldens | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P2 | Venues: FIX 4.4, SBE book feed, D2C RFQ, D2D CLOB with workup, SEF rules, event loop | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P3 | Quoting engine, risk engine, hedger | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P4 | Smart order router | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |
| P5 | Back-tester with pre-registration (W7), Python quant research (W10); latency jobs | 18 | 1.5 | 0.3 (branch work, 2026-10-31) | 2026-10-31 | gate open |
| P6 | Documentation, regulation mapping, knowledge check, release | to be set at P0 gate | | | | not started |

## Estimate versus actual

Filled at each gate. Each entry records the planned and actual figures, the reviewer and CI time separately from working time, and what the difference is attributed to.

### P0 gate

Not yet reached. Planned: 10 plan-days, 1 wall-clock day, started 2026-10-31.

### P5 gate (W7 back-testing, W10 research)

Planned: 18 plan-days, 1.5 wall-clock days. Actual: one session on 2026-10-31, from about 01:00 to 08:00 UTC including a pause while the coordinating session changed models, so about 0.3 calendar days elapsed; active working time was not measured. Review and CI time are not included: the branch is pushed for the coordinator's combined pull request and has not run in GitHub Actions yet.

Gate checks, all run locally on 2026-10-31 on Windows 11 with JDK 25.0.5 and Python 3.12.10:

| Check | Where | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Determinism: a second run of a synthetic day reproduces P&L to the cent, same output hash and tables | `DeterminismTest` | passed |
| Ledger refuses an unregistered run and a holdout overlap | `LedgerTest`, recipe 18 | passed |
| Attribution reconciles to position P&L below one cent on every run | `AttributionReconciliationTest`, `test_java_outputs_reconcile` | passed |
| First pre-registered experiment recorded whatever its result | `data/ledger/ledger.jsonl` line 1, `FirstExperimentTest` | recorded: not supported |
| Hit-rate model out-of-sample log-loss below the constant baseline | preset `usd_rfq_hit_rate` | 0.6146 against 0.6900 |
| Daily report runs unattended | `ReportTest` (`ReportCli`) | passed |
| Python: ruff, ruff format, mypy strict, pytest, notebooks, cookbook | CI python job commands | 38 tests passed; 5 notebooks executed; 6 recipes match |
| Coverage floor and SpotBugs on `rates-backtest` | `mvn -B -ntp verify` | floor met, 0 bugs |

What the difference between plan and actual is attributed to: the plan assumed the venue simulators and the event loop would be available; building against synthetic journals and the back-tester's own outcome models removed that integration work from this phase and moved it to the coordinator's binding step.

Deferred from P5, with reasons: the latency job and its histogram (the report reads the harness JSON when it exists; no harness was built in this branch); binding to the P2 loop's replay mode and to the venue simulators (not available to this session); FINRA Treasury data (API needs an account; loader and synthetic fixture shipped); opening the P5-001 holdout (kept unread; it opens once, in a later run).

## Open items

- P0: local verification done on 2026-10-31 (mvn verify on JDK 25.0.5 and JDK 27: 50 Java tests, coverage floor met, SpotBugs clean; ruff, mypy, pytest 16 passed; mkdocs build --strict clean; cookbook recipes recorded and checked by tools/check_cookbook.py). The gate closes when the same jobs are green in GitHub Actions on Linux and Windows.
- P0: the repository is private until the owner is satisfied (DR-001 amendment); the site deploys once it is public and the Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" (docs/GITHUB_PAGES.md).
