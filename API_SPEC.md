# API specification: the pinned, cross-module contract

This document is the contract between modules and between the Java and Python sides. Anything stated here is fixed for the schema or format version it names; a change needs a new version number, a decision record in `DECISIONS.md` and a migration note in `CHANGELOG.md`. Where code and this document disagree, the one that was reviewed last is wrong and the pull request that fixes it must say which.

Phase 0 pins Sections 0 to 4. Sections 5 onward arrive with P1.

## Section 0. Units and conventions

| Quantity | Representation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Price or rate | `int64` mantissa with fixed exponent `-9` | A price of 99.123456789 is the mantissa 99123456789. A rate of 4.25 percent is quoted as 4.25 and stored as 4250000000. The exponent is a constant in the SBE schema (`priceExponent = -9`), never a per-message field. Range: about plus or minus 9.2 billion units, which covers any price per 100 of face and any rate in percent. |
| Quantity | `int64` | Swaps: notional in the currency's minor unit (USD cents, EUR cents, GBP pence). Bonds and futures: face value in the currency's minor unit. 100 million USD notional is 10,000,000,000. |
| Time stamps | `int64` epoch nanoseconds, UTC | From `Clock.epochNanos()`. Range exceeds year 2200. |
| Durations and intervals | `int64` nanoseconds | From differences of `Clock.nanoTime()`, which is monotonic and has no defined epoch. Never mix the two clocks in one subtraction. |
| Instrument id | `int32` | Assigned by the securities master (planned P1). Zero is never a valid id. |
| Sequence numbers | `int64`, 1-based, strictly increasing by 1 | Journal frames, order ids within a session, RFQ ids within a venue session. Zero means "none". |
| Side | enum `uint8` | 1 = Buy, 2 = Sell, from the client's perspective in RFQ and order messages. |
| Currency | 3-byte ASCII, ISO 4217 | Fixed-length `char[3]`. |
| Byte order | little-endian throughout | SBE schema `byteOrder="littleEndian"`; journal header and frame fields likewise. |

Floating-point values do not appear on the wire or in the journal. Analytics (P1) convert at the boundary and state the rounding rule when they do.

## Section 1. Journal file and frame format

Format name `RAJ1`. One journal is one or more segment files of equal size; Phase 0 implements a single segment.

### 1.1 File header (32 bytes, offset 0)

| Offset | Size | Type | Field | Value or meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `char[4]` | magic | ASCII `RAJ1` (bytes 0x52 0x41 0x4A 0x31; read as a little-endian int32 it is 0x314A4152) |
| 4 | 2 | `uint16` | formatVersion | 1 |
| 6 | 2 | `uint16` | headerLength | 32 |
| 8 | 4 | `int32` | capacityBytes | mapped size of this file in bytes, including the header; a reader refuses a buffer of any other size |
| 12 | 8 | `int64` | createdEpochNanos | `Clock.epochNanos()` when the segment was created |
| 20 | 12 | bytes | reserved | all zero; readers ignore, writers must write zero |

### 1.2 Frame (variable length, frames are contiguous from offset 32)

| Offset in frame | Size | Type | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `int32` | frameLength | total bytes of this frame including this field; 0 marks end of data |
| 4 | 8 | `int64` | sequence | 1 for the first frame, then previous plus 1 |
| 12 | 8 | `int64` | timestampNanos | epoch nanoseconds supplied by the writer's caller |
| 20 | 2 | `uint16` | templateId | SBE template id of the payload |
| 22 | 2 | `uint16` | schemaVersion | SBE schema version the payload was encoded with |
| 24 | 8 | `int64` | chainHash | FNV-1a 64 of previous chainHash and this payload (1.3) |
| 32 | frameLength minus 32 | bytes | payload | the SBE message, header included, exactly as it was on the ring buffer |

The frame header is 32 bytes. `frameLength` is at least 32 and counts header plus payload without padding. The next frame starts at the current frame's offset plus `frameLength` rounded up to a multiple of 8, so every frame header is 8-byte aligned; the padding bytes are zero and are not hashed. `timestampNanos` is taken from the writer's `Clock.epochNanos()` at append time.

End of data is the first position at which the `int32` read is zero. A segment is zero-filled on creation so an unwritten region reads as end of data. A writer that cannot fit a frame in the remaining space writes nothing and reports the segment full; it does not write a partial frame.

### 1.3 Chain hash

The hash is FNV-1a, 64-bit:

- offset basis `0xcbf29ce484222325`
- prime `0x100000001b3`
- for each byte: `h = (h XOR byte) * prime`, modulo 2 to the 64

The input bytes for frame *n* are the 8 little-endian bytes of frame *n* minus 1's `chainHash`, followed by frame *n*'s payload bytes (offset 32 to `frameLength`). For the first frame the previous hash is 0, so the input begins with eight zero bytes. The frame header fields other than the previous hash are not hashed; sequence continuity is checked separately by the reader.

Java stores the result in a signed `long`; the bit pattern is what is compared. `research/ratesresearch/fnv.py` implements the same function and its tests (`research/tests/test_fnv.py`) check the definition independently.

### 1.4 Reader obligations

A reader must verify, for each frame: `frameLength >= 32`, `sequence == previous + 1`, `chainHash` equals the recomputed value. On any failure it stops and reports the sequence number of the failing frame (Section 4). A reader does not interpret the payload; that is the handler's job.

## Section 2. SBE schema v1

Source of truth: `rates-messages/src/main/resources/sbe/rates-schema-v1.xml`. Package `io.ratesalgo.messages.sbe`, schema id 1, version 0, semantic version 1.0.0, little-endian, all messages fixed length (no groups, no var-data) in v1. This section lists the messages so that other documents can refer to them; the XML wins on any difference.

Shared types: `Decimal9` is a composite of `mantissa` int64 and a constant `exponent` of -9; `Ccy` is `char[3]` ASCII; `Tenor` is `char[4]` ASCII, space padded; `EpochNanos`, `Quantity` and `SeqNo` are int64; `InstrumentId`, `PartyId` and `VenueId` are int32. Enums are uint8: `Side` (Buy 1, Sell 2), `BookAction` (Add, Change, Delete, Clear), `QuoteStatus` (Done, TradedAway, Expired, Rejected, Passed), `OrdStatus` (New 0, PartiallyFilled 1, Filled 2, Cancelled 4, Rejected 8), `OrdType` (Market, Limit), `TimeInForce` (Day 0, ImmediateOrCancel 3, FillOrKill 4, GoodTillDate 6), `CurveInputKind` (Fixing, Future, ParSwap, Bond), `LimitKind` (Position, BucketDv01, NetDv01, GrossDv01, DailyLoss, OrderRate, QuoteRate, MaxOrderSize, PriceCollar), `KillReason` (Manual, LimitBreach, FeedGap, SessionLoss, StaleReference).

| Template id | Message | Fields (in order) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Heartbeat | `sourceId` int32, `timestampNanos` |
| 2 | BookUpdate | `venueId`, `instrumentId`, `venueSeqNo`, `side`, `action`, `level` uint8, `price` Decimal9, `quantity`, `orderCount` int32, `timestampNanos` |
| 3 | CurveInput | `curveId` int32, `kind` CurveInputKind, `instrumentId`, `tenor`, `value` Decimal9, `timestampNanos` |
| 10 | QuoteRequest | `venueId`, `rfqId` int64, `clientId`, `instrumentId`, `side` (the client's side), `quantity`, `currency`, `dealerCount` uint8, `receivedNanos`, `expiryNanos` |
| 11 | Quote | `venueId`, `rfqId`, `quoteId` int64, `instrumentId`, `bidPrice`, `askPrice`, `bidQuantity`, `askQuantity`, `referenceNanos` (newest input the price depends on), `validUntilNanos`, `sentNanos` |
| 12 | QuoteResponse | `venueId`, `rfqId`, `quoteId`, `status` QuoteStatus, `tradedPrice`, `tradedQuantity`, `coverPrice` (second best, when disclosed to the winner), `timestampNanos` |
| 20 | NewOrder | `venueId`, `clOrdId` int64, `parentId` int64 (router parent, 0 if none), `instrumentId`, `side`, `ordType`, `timeInForce`, `price`, `quantity`, `expireNanos`, `sentNanos` |
| 21 | ExecutionReport | `venueId`, `clOrdId`, `venueOrderId` int64, `execId` int64, `instrumentId`, `side`, `ordStatus`, `lastPrice`, `lastQuantity`, `leavesQuantity`, `cumQuantity`, `transactNanos` |
| 30 | RiskLimitBreach | `limitKind`, `scopeId` int32, `limitValue` Decimal9, `observedValue` Decimal9, `rejectedMessageSeqNo` (journal sequence of the rejected message, 0 if post-trade), `timestampNanos` |
| 31 | KillSwitch | `reason` KillReason, `scopeId` int32 (0 for the whole process), `requestedBy` PartyId, `timestampNanos` |

Every message is preceded on the wire by the standard SBE `messageHeader` (blockLength uint16, templateId uint16, schemaId uint16, version uint16), 8 bytes. `QuoteRequest` has block length 49, so its encoded length is 57 (COOKBOOK.md recipe 3).

Versioning rule: adding a field to the end of a message with `sinceVersion` increments the schema version and keeps template ids. Changing a field's type or position requires a new schema id and a new XML file; v1 is never edited in place once a journal written with it exists in a release.

## Section 3. Clock and timer semantics

### 3.1 Clock

```java
public interface Clock {
    long nanoTime();    // monotonic, for intervals; no defined epoch
    long epochNanos();  // wall clock, UTC, for stamps
}
```

- `SystemClock.INSTANCE`: `nanoTime()` from `System.nanoTime()`; `epochNanos()` from `Instant.now()` to the precision the platform provides. `Instant.now()` allocates, so the event loop never calls it; stamps are taken on the gateway thread or read from inbound messages.
- `ManualClock(epochNanos)` starts wall time where the constructor says and monotonic time at a fixed, unrelated origin (1 000 000 000 ns), so code that mixes the two clocks is caught in tests. `ManualClock()` starts at 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z. `advance(nanos)` adds the same amount to both readings and rejects negative values; `setEpochNanos(t)` is `advance(t - epochNanos())`.

Intervals are always differences of `nanoTime()`. Stamps written to messages and journals are always `epochNanos()`. In replay the `Replayer` drives a `ManualClock` forward to each frame's `timestampNanos` (never backwards), so the replayed system sees the same stamps as the live one.

### 3.2 TimerWheel

`TimerWheel(tickNanos, wheelSize, initialCapacity, startNanos)`: tick length, number of slots (rounded up to a power of two), timers that can be live before the arrays grow, and the `nanoTime()` reading that is tick zero.

- `long schedule(long deadlineNanos, TimerHandler handler)`: registers a timer and returns an id that is unique for the life of the wheel and strictly increasing. Deadlines are in `nanoTime()` units.
- `boolean cancel(long id)`: removes a pending timer; returns false if it has fired, was already cancelled, or never existed.
- `int poll(long nowNanos)`: fires every pending timer with `deadlineNanos <= nowNanos`, in ascending deadline order and for equal deadlines in ascending id order, and returns the count. The handler receives `(timerId, nowNanos)`. The firing order does not depend on how often `poll` is called; `TimerWheelProperties` checks this for random schedules and poll steps.
- A timer never fires early. A timer whose deadline passed while the loop was busy fires on the next `poll` with that poll's `nowNanos`, so a handler can measure its lateness against the deadline it stored.
- Handlers may schedule and cancel while being fired; a timer scheduled from a handler fires no earlier than the next poll.

There is no scheduler thread. `schedule`, `cancel` and `poll` do not allocate once the wheel has grown to its working size; the P2 allocation job will assert this on the event loop.

## Section 4. Error behaviour

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Journal chain hash mismatch, sequence gap, `frameLength` below 32, or a frame running past the file | `JournalReader.next` and `Replayer.replay` throw `JournalCorruptionException` carrying the sequence number of the failing frame. Frames before it were delivered; none after it are. |
| Journal file header wrong (magic, format version, header length, or declared capacity not equal to the buffer size) | `JournalCorruptionException` with sequence 0 at open. |
| Zero `frameLength` | End of data, not an error. A crash that leaves a partial frame leaves its length zero, because the length is written last. |
| Journal full on `append` | `JournalFullException`; nothing is written and the writer stays usable. Segment rolling is planned for P2. |
| `JournalWriter.create` on an existing path, or a capacity too small for a header and one frame header | `IllegalArgumentException`. |
| Use of a closed `JournalWriter` | `IllegalStateException`; `close()` is idempotent. |
| SBE schema id or version mismatch on decode | The decoding site throws `IllegalStateException` naming expected and actual values. Handlers never decode a payload whose header does not match. |
| Timer handler throws | Every timer due in that `poll` still fires; the wheel then rethrows the first exception with the others attached as suppressed. The failed timer has been removed. |
| `ManualClock.advance` with a negative argument, or `setEpochNanos` earlier than now | `IllegalArgumentException`. Time does not go backwards. |

Exceptions carry enough to reproduce: sequence, expected and actual values. Nothing is logged and swallowed.

## Section 5 onward

Sections 5 onward arrive with P1: market conventions (day counts, calendars, business-day rules, settlement lags per currency), curve bootstrap (instruments, interpolation, tolerances), pricing formulas and their tolerances against QuantLib (relative error with an absolute floor, stated per quantity).
